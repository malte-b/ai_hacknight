## Assembly AI Challenge

Number of sentences: 363

### "How many times did they mention the word 'weaviate'?"
The word 'weaviate' is mentioned 9 times in the transcript.

--> actually I checked it's 11 times, so the LLM is wrong here, because we would need an agent for aggregation

### "Outline the main points of the podcast."
Here's an outline of the main points discussed in the podcast:

1. Introduction to Agentic RAG
   - Components of an agent: language model, memory, planning, tools
   - Difference between vanilla RAG and Agentic RAG

2. Planning in Agent Systems
   - Discussion of different planning approaches (React, Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts)
   - Comparison of planning methods and their potential applications

3. Multi-Agent Systems
   - Structure of multi-agent systems (top-level agent, specialized sub-agents)
   - Benefits of using different language models for different roles
   - Comparison to DSPY framework

4. Memory in Agent Systems
   - Short-term vs. long-term memory
   - Discussion of Letta framework for updating agent memory

5. Evaluation and Observability in AI Systems
   - Tools for observability (Arises, Telemetry, Phoenix)
   - Challenges with using LLMs as judges
   - Ensembling and sampling multiple inferences for more robust results

6. Developer Experience for Building Agents
   - Challenges in defining tools and functions
   - Potential for low-code/no-code solutions

7. Generative Feedback Loops (GFLs)
   - Role of agents in GFLs
   - Long-running processes for content generation
   - Integration with external tools and data sources

8. Human-in-the-Loop Considerations
   - Importance of human oversight in autonomous systems
   - Balancing AI autonomy with human control

9. Future Directions
   - Potential for storing and reusing intermediate outputs in complex tasks
   - AI-native businesses leveraging generative feedback loops

The podcast concludes with a mention of an upcoming event in New York City where these topics will be further discussed.

### "Make a viral Linkedin post out of the podcast."

üöÄ Exciting times in AI! Just wrapped up an incredible podcast on Agentic RAG with @Erica Cardenas from Weaviate. Here are the key takeaways:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Agentic RAG is revolutionizing how we interact with data, going beyond traditional retrieval-augment-generate pipelines.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-agent systems are the future, allowing for specialized roles and more efficient problem-solving.

3Ô∏è‚É£ The importance of short-term and long-term memory in AI agents can't be overstated.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation and observability tools are crucial for building trust and understanding in AI systems.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Generative Feedback Loops (GFLs) are opening up new possibilities for AI-driven data creation and enhancement.

üî• Hot take: The next big leap in AI won't just be about better models, but smarter ways to combine and orchestrate them!

üë• Want to dive deeper? Join us next Tuesday in NYC at the Google Pier 57 building to discuss Agentic RAG and the future of AI!

### "Summarize the podcast as a christmas carol."

üéµ On the first day of AI, Weaviate gave to me:
An agentic RAG system with glee!

On the second day of AI, Weaviate gave to me:
Two function calls,
And an agentic RAG system with glee!

On the third day of AI, Weaviate gave to me:
Three planning steps,
Two function calls,
And an agentic RAG system with glee!

On the fourth day of AI, Weaviate gave to me:
Four multi-agents,
Three planning steps,
Two function calls,
And an agentic RAG system with glee!

On the fifth day of AI, Weaviate gave to me:
Five eval tools!
Four multi-agents,
Three planning steps,
Two function calls,
And an agentic RAG system with glee!

On the sixth day of AI, Weaviate gave to me:
Six loops a-generating,
Five eval tools!
Four multi-agents,
Three planning steps,
Two function calls,
And an agentic RAG system with glee! üéµ
